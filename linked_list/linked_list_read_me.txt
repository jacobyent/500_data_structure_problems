This section is for the linked list problems. 
Besides arrays linked lists were the data structure I had the most practice with so this section was relatively pain free. 
I was quite pleased with how my code turned out for most of the problems and how I often had a solution that was as good or better than techie's. 
I built the template file as I went along, in the future I think I will just create my own class to store the functions so they aren't polluting the code. 
If I need to store functions that is. 
Overall I thought the problems were a good challenge and a good reminder about what I'm still weak on. 
Specifically for linked lists I got mixed up frequently when I was trying to in place swap two nodes.
In the future working with linked lists I think I will first use/create a class object for the list and then use/build functions for a lot of the operations rather than work through the proper
logic every time. 

Looking over my code I noticed that I didn't comment nearly as much as I wanted.
Looking over everything I missed two problems: the palindrome problem and the move last node to front. 
I'm not sure if I'll go back to them immediatly or at all, although the do look simple enough.
I skipped over some of the sections that were just explanations and looking now I think I should've done the problems were you implement the list as a queue and stack.
I'm a little sick of linked lists for the moment though so I'll come back to these problems at a later date.
Finally, I think this practice is going well. 
Originally I was thinking I would spend about 10 minutes per problem, start to finish. 
I have not matched this goal at all. 
Roughly estimating I think it takes about 30 minutes on average per problem. 
This isn't horrible and I will readjust my expectations going forward. 

# of problems: 21. Average time to complete: 30mins. Total time ~ 10.5 hours.
