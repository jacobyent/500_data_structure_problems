This directory contains my self study of data strucutres and algorithms. This is primarily done by attempting practice problems provided
by: https://techiedelight.quora.com/500-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-practice-problems-and-their-solutions.
I plan to use these skills in seeking employment in a high tech company. 

2021 update: Restarting this challenge after getting a job in devops for a few years. Working on becoming a full SDE. Going to run through these
challenges in python this time.
